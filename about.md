LPG Inventory Solutions is a privately owned Canadian company. We are a full service Pharmaceutical Wholesaler.
We strive at all times to maintain a personal service level to each of our customers and can be reached by phone from 9:00am to 5:00pm Monday to Friday.

We provide a 24/7 online ordering system. Provide same-day delivery service to most parts of the GTA and next day before noon to the rest of the Province.

LPG Inventory Solutions was founded in 2001 by two Ontario pharmacists in response to dissatisfaction with the existing Pharmaceutical Wholesalers. Decreasing availability of direct accounts, increasing wholesaler mark-ups and diminished service levels caused us to pursue options to initiate our own pharmaceutical wholesaler.

We began with a small facility in Concord, Ontario and serviced a core group of independent pharmacists in Southern Ontario. In October 2009, we obtained our Narcotics and Controlled Drug License, as well as a Medical Devices license and expanded our business to include more Branded and Generic manufacturers. We moved our facility to a larger site in Hamilton, Ontario and began servicing a broader client base.

Our business model has certainly changed over the last decade as has the Pharmaceutical Industry we work within. Our smaller size has proven beneficial as it allows us to modify our business quickly and customize programs with each of our Pharmacy partners.
